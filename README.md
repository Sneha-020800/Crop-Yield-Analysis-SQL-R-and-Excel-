# 🌾 Crop Yield Analysis (SQL, R & Excel)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on *global crop yield analysis* using a combination of tools:
- *SQL* → Database creation, data cleaning, querying, and exploratory insights.  
- *R Programming* → Statistical analysis, visualizations, and predictive modeling.  
- *Excel* → Dashboarding and business-friendly insights.  

The goal is to study *agricultural productivity, efficiency, and sustainability* between 1990–2013

## ⚙ Tools & Technologies
- *SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL)* – Data storage, cleaning & queries  
- *R Programming* – Data visualization & regression modeling  
- *Excel* – Dashboards & charts for quick insights

## 📊 Key Insights
- 📈 *Crop yields increased ~47%* globally between 1990–2013.  
- 🥔 *Potatoes* are the most productive crop, followed by cassava, yams, and sweet potatoes.  
- 🌡 *Cooler regions* achieved the highest yields, while moderate climates performed the worst.  
- 💧 *Rainfall had weak correlation* with yield, proving irrigation and technology are more important.  
- 🧪 *Pesticide use doubled* between 1990–2013, raising sustainability concerns.  
- 🌍 *Egypt* showed the best *water-use efficiency, while **Pakistan & Bahrain* excelled in *eco-efficiency*.  

## 🛠 Methodology
1. *SQL Phase*  
   - Created database & table structure.  
   - Cleaned data (removed duplicates & nulls, averaged duplicates).  
   - Queried for yield trends, top crops, pesticide usage, and efficiency.  

2. *R Phase*  
   - Visualized yield patterns with bar, line, scatter, and heatmap charts.  
   - Built regression models for yield prediction.  
   - Improved model accuracy using log transformation.  

3. *Excel Phase*  
   - Designed interactive dashboard.  
   - Showcased trends in rainfall, pesticide use, and crop yields.  
   - Highlighted top crops and sustainability concerns.
